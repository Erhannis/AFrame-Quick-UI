Package for A-Frame, to easily/quickly make UIs, with the primary use case of on-controller menus in mind.  The name is a WIP.  Some of the code comes from A-Painter, in which context and codebase I originally wrote this code.  There may still be cruft left over, sorry.  See AFrameHandMenusTest for an example of how to use it.  See also examples/hand-menu.js for examples of how to use different kinds of UI.  See src/components/hand-menu.js for the different layouts etc. available.  (There's a list at the bottom.)
